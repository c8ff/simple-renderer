#  simple-renderer
A simple rendering library. This library is mostly an abstraction layer of OpenGL and Legacy OpenGL. Support for other APIs like Vulkan is not planned.
<br>This library was inspired heavily by libgdx.

## Disclaimer
This library is not intended for professional use. The structure of it can change on any update. A lot of the code was written by me, a guy that barely understands OpenGL.<p>
LegacyOpenGLRenderer2 might be considered unstable or downright unusable, use OpenGLRenderer instead.

## FAQ
### Why?
Well, most libraries are very complicated (in my opinion), so I created my own.
